``port-for`` is a command-line utility and a python library that
helps with local TCP ports management.

It can find an unused TCP localhost port and remember the association::

    $ sudo port-for foo
    37987

This can be useful when you are installing a stack of software
with multiple parts needing port numbers.

.. note::

    If you're looking for a temporary port then ``socket.bind((host, 0))``
    is your best bet::

        >>> import socket
        >>> s = socket.socket()
        >>> s.bind(("", 0))
        >>> s.getsockname()
        ('0.0.0.0', 54485)

    ``port-for`` is necessary when you need *persistent* free local port number.

    ``port-for`` is the exact opposite of ``s.bind((host, 0))``
    in the sense that it shouldn't return ports that ``s.bind((host, 0))``
    may return (because such ports are likely to be temporary used by OS).


There are several rules ``port-for`` is trying to follow to find and
return a new unused port:

1) Port must be unused: ``port-for`` checks this by trying to connect
   to the port and to bind to it.

2) Port must be IANA unassigned and otherwise not well-known:
   this is acheived by maintaining unassigned ports list
   (parsed from IANA and Wikipedia).

3) Port shouldn't be inside ephemeral port range.
   This is important because ports from ephemeral port range can
   be assigned temporary by OS (e.g. by machine's IP stack) and
   this may prevent service restart in some circumstances.
   ``port-for`` doesn't return ports from ephemeral port ranges
   configured at the current machine.

4) Other heuristics are also applied: ``port-for`` tries to return
   a port from larger port ranges; it also doesn't return ports that are
   too close to well-known ports.

Installation
============

System-wide using easy_install (something like ``python-setuptools``
should be installed)::

    sudo pip install port-for

or::

    sudo easy_install port-for

or inside a virtualenv::

    pip install port-for

Script usage
============

``port-for <foo>`` script finds an unused port and associates
it with ``<foo>``. Subsequent calls return the same port number.

This utility doesn't actually bind the port or otherwise prevents the
port from being taken by another software. It tries to select
a port that is less likely to be used by another software
(and that is unused at the time of calling of course). Utility also makes
sure that ``port-for bar`` won't return the same port as ``port-for foo``
on the same machine.

::

    $ sudo port-for foo
    37987

    $ port-for foo
    37987

You may want to develop some naming conventions (e.g. prefix your app names)
in order to enable multiple sites on the same server::

    $ sudo port-for example.com/apache
    35456

Please note that ``port-for`` script requires read and write access
to ``/etc/port-for.conf``. This usually means regular users can read
port values but sudo is required to associate a new port.

List all associated ports::

    $ port-for --list
    foo: 37987
    example.com/apache: 35456

Remove an association::

    $ sudo port-for --unbind foo
    $ port-for --list
    example.com/apache: 35456


Library usage
=============

::

    >>> import port_for
    >>> port_for.select_random()
    37774

    >>> port_for.select_random()
    48324

    >>> 80 in port_for.available_good_ports()
    False

# Port Selection Function - Architectural Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the architectural decisions and design patterns implemented in the `get_port()` function, providing insights for future port management feature development.

## Architectural Patterns

### Design Pattern Implementation
- **Type-Based Dispatch Pattern**: Chosen over duck typing for clear semantics
- **Fail-Fast Pattern**: Special cases handled first for better error reporting
- **Union Pattern**: Heterogeneous input collection and normalization
- **Builder Pattern**: Extensible port selection with PortSelector class

### Core Architecture Decisions

#### Input Handling Strategy
```python
def get_port(ports):
    # Special cases first (fail-fast)
    # Single values (no availability check)
    # Collections (with availability checks)

# Production-Grade Port Selection Architecture

## Overview
This document presents a comprehensive architectural solution for robust port selection in distributed containerized environments. The implementation addresses fundamental race conditions through layered defense strategies and provides enterprise-grade reliability for port management.

## Architectural Design Principles

### Three-Layer Defense Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Layer 1: Strategy Layer          │
│   (Constraints, Preferences, Validation) │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                     │
┌────────────────────▼────────────────────┐
│         Layer 2: Claim Layer             │
│   (Distributed Locking, Atomic Binding)  │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────▼────────────────────┐
│      Layer 3: Verification Layer         │
│   (Post-claim Validation, Race Detection)│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Design Pattern Implementation

#### Builder Pattern for Configuration
```python
strategy = PortSelectionStrategy() \
    .exclude_ports(3306, 5432, 6379) \
    .prefer_range(8000, 9000) \
    .add_validator(custom_checker)
```

#### Atomic Operations Pattern
```python
class PortClaimer:
    def try_claim(self):
        # File lock + immediate bind + claim verification
        # Eliminates all race condition windows
```

## Core Components

### PortSelectionStrategy
**Purpose**: Declarative constraint and preference management
**Features**:
- Fluent API for configuration
- Multiple exclusion mechanisms (ports, ranges, patterns)
- Weighted preference system
- Custom validation functions
- Composable constraint building

### PortClaimer
**Purpose**: Atomic port acquisition with distributed coordination
**Key Innovations**:
- **Distributed file locking**: Works across containers and hosts
- **Immediate binding verification**: OS-level port exclusivity
- **Post-claim validation**: Detects late-manifesting race conditions
- **Automatic cleanup**: Resource leak prevention

### RobustPortSelector
**Purpose**: High-level orchestration with enterprise features
**Features**:
- Multi-strategy retry logic
- Jitter for thundering herd prevention
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Performance metrics collection

## Race Condition Analysis and Solutions

### Identified Race Conditions

#### 1. Check-then-Bind Gap
**Problem**: Time window between availability check and binding
**Solution**: Atomic check-and-bind operations
```python
# No gap between check and bind
sock.bind(('', port))  # OS guarantees exclusivity
```

#### 2. Distributed State Synchronization
**Problem**: Multiple processes checking same port simultaneously
**Solution**: Distributed file locking with immediate binding
```python
fcntl.flock(lockf.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)
```

#### 3. Post-Selection Conflicts
**Problem**: Port becomes unavailable after selection
**Solution**: Verification phase with configurable delay
```python
def verify_claim(self, delay=0.1):
    time.sleep(delay)  # Let races manifest
    return self.still_own_claim()
```

## Advanced Features

### Container Orchestration Integration
- **Kubernetes volume mounts** for shared lock storage
- **Container ID detection** for instance identification
- **Network namespace awareness** for port isolation
- **Graceful shutdown handling** for clean resource release

### Performance Optimization
- **O(1) lock acquisition** through port-specific locks
- **Random sampling** instead of exhaustive scanning
- **Configurable verification delays** for speed/safety trade-offs
- **Lock contention metrics** for bottleneck identification

### Observability and Monitoring
```python
# Metrics tracked automatically
port_allocation_attempts.increment()
port_allocation_success.increment()
port_allocation_duration.observe(elapsed)
port_claim_contention.observe(lock_wait_time)
```

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Suite

#### Race Condition Tests
- **Concurrent claims**: Multiple processes claiming same port
- **Thundering herd**: More workers than available ports
- **Port reuse**: Cleanup and re-acquisition validation
- **Stale lock cleanup**: Orphaned claim recovery

#### Production Scenario Simulation
- **System service conflicts**: Blacklist validation
- **Container restart patterns**: Offset effectiveness
- **Network partition recovery**: Distributed lock behavior
- **Resource exhaustion**: Graceful degradation testing

#### Performance Benchmarking
- **Latency measurements**: Single acquisition timing
- **Throughput testing**: Concurrent acquisition rates
- **Contention analysis**: Lock wait time distribution
- **Memory usage**: Resource leak detection

## Production Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] Shared storage mounted across containers
- [ ] File locking support in filesystem
- [ ] Monitoring infrastructure for port metrics
- [ ] Log aggregation for distributed debugging

### Configuration Templates

#### Microservice Deployment
```python
# Production-ready configuration
selector = RobustPortSelector(
    PortSelectionStrategy()
    .exclude_ports(*SYSTEM_SERVICES)
    .prefer_range(8000, 9000)
    .add_validator(firewall_allows_port)
)

port, claimer = selector.select_and_claim(
    app_id=f"{service_name}_{instance_id}",
    max_attempts=10,
    verify_delay=0.1
)
```

#### High-Availability Setup
```python
# Multi-region deployment
strategy = PortSelectionStrategy() \
    .exclude_range(1, 1024) \
    .prefer_range(8000, 8999, weight=2.0) \
    .prefer_range(9000, 9999, weight=1.0) \
    .add_validator(region_specific_checker)
```

## Operational Procedures

### Health Monitoring
