# Port Selection Function - Architectural Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the architectural decisions and design patterns implemented in the `get_port()` function, providing insights for future port management feature development.

## Architectural Patterns

### Design Pattern Implementation
- **Type-Based Dispatch Pattern**: Chosen over duck typing for clear semantics
- **Fail-Fast Pattern**: Special cases handled first for better error reporting
- **Union Pattern**: Heterogeneous input collection and normalization
- **Builder Pattern**: Extensible port selection with PortSelector class

### Core Architecture Decisions

#### Input Handling Strategy
```python
def get_port(ports):
    # Special cases first (fail-fast)
    # Single values (no availability check)
    # Collections (with availability checks)
